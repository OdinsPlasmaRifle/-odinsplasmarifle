I am a software engineer who enjoys collaborating with colleagues to solve difficult problems for users.

I live in Cape Town, South Africa where I work as the VP of Engineering for Rehive, a fintech,  wallet, and infrastructure company. I spend a lot of time working with our engineering and product teams to deliver sensible software solutions.
