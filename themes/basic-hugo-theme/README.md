# Hexon Hugo Theme

A minimal theme for a basic blog website in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Quick start

Navigate to your Hugo `themes` folder and install with `git`:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:OdinsPlasmaRifle/basic-hugo-theme.git
```

or if you want to install within an existing git repository:

```sh
git submodule add git@github.com:OdinsPlasmaRifle/basic-hugo-theme.git
```

## Usage

Take a look at the `exampleSite` folder within the theme. You can copy the whole folder's contents into your Hugo project or just the parts you want.

Once done you can run the Hugo development server:

```sh
hugo serve
```

You can then go to [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) to see the theme in action.
